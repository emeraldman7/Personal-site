<p>I've been drawing since 2019 and I've been liking it ever since. I'm kinda a big fan of robot, soldier, and knight designs they're pretty cool and I want to make my own. I'm been doing some doodles of my characters (still working on the poses though) and I've been having fun of that. I'm pretty shy to show them since my designs..........aren't really the best. But I've been improving alot and I'm still doing it today so I'll try to make this work out in the end.</p>

<p>I know that this isn't the most productive way to kill my time but I want to know about how people make games great in the first place. In some games to their genres like RPGs, platforming, fighting games and such, I enjoyed playing games like Mega Man, Smash Bros, and Xenoblade Chronincles and all of them have charm and fun as they were supposed to be.</p>
